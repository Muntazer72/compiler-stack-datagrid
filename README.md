# Compiler Construction - Lab Activity 02
### Stack Data Structure & DataGridView Implementation

## 👨‍💻 Student Information
* **Name:** Muntazer Mahdi
* **Roll Number:** 2023-CS-72
* **University:** Muhammad Nawaz Sharif University of Engineering and Technology (MNS-UET), Multan
* **Semester:** 6th (BS Computer Science)
* **Session:** 2023–2027

---

## 📝 Project Overview
This project is a web-based implementation of core concepts required for designing a compiler. It focuses on managing a **Symbol Stack** and visualizing data through a dynamic interface that mimics the `DataGridView` found in C# environments.

### Lab Objectives:
1. **Dynamic Data Grid:** Displaying and retrieving values from a structured table.
2. **Run-time Insertion:** Ability to add tokens/values to the UI at runtime.
3. **Stack Implementation:** A functional LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure to manage compiler states.

---

## ✨ Features
* **Startup Sequence:** A professional 1-second "Warm Welcome" splash screen showcasing developer credentials.
* **Persistent Session:** Optimized loading that ensures the startup menu appears only on a fresh page reload.
* **Interactive UI:** High-end CSS styling with professional headings and a responsive layout.
* **Stack Operations:** Visual representation of `Push` and `Pop` operations with a Stack Pointer (SP).

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Backend:** Python 3.x (Flask Framework)
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Styling:** Custom Modern CSS (Variables, Flexbox, Keyframe Animations)

### Why this is a "High-End" README:
* **Visual Hierarchy:** It uses emojis and clear headers to guide the reader's eye.
* **Technical Detail:** It explicitly mentions the "Stack Pointer" and "LIFO" logic, which shows you understand the underlying Compiler Construction concepts.
* **Clear Instructions:** Anyone (including your professor) can download and run your code in seconds.



**Would you like me to help you create a "Demo" video or a GIF of your app running to add to this README as well?**
